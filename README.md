This is an admin dashboard application made with vite + reactjs and for styling tailwind css is used. The UI model is truly amazing and its my first dashboard application. I made it with the help of youtube tutorial but the tailwind css stylation is done by myself. In youtube stylation was done with scss but I did the stylation with tailwind css.

On making this project I learned a lots of new things of using the charts and advanced grid styles.

It's a frontend application and there is no backend part of it.

In the menu bar all the routing pages are not implemented only the Home, Profile, Users and Products are implemented.

From the product page or the user page in the action part there will be two icons one view icon and the other one delete icon. On clicking the view icon you will get redirect to the single page about the user or the item.


Installation of the application
