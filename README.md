This is an admin dashboard application made with vite + reactjs and for styling tailwind css is used. The UI model is truly amazing and its my first dashboard application. I made it with the help of youtube tutorial but the tailwind css stylation is done by myself. In youtube stylation was done with scss but I did the stylation with tailwind css.

It's a frontend application and there is no backend part of it.

## Key Features
- Seamless navigation with a menu bar for quick access to Home, Profile, Users, and Products sections but the other navigation are not implemented.
